                "question": "How is BST COACH better than the good-old pen and paper?",
                "answer": "This seems obvious but it is actually a hard question to answer if we are very honest with ourselves. Writing a note to an athlete on a piece of paper wins the simplicity contest. Learning a new platform is unquestionably harder. But a piece of paper has its limits. It doesn't scale, it doesn't demonstrate exercises, it doesn't offer training ideas, and you cannot automate it.",
            },
            {
                "question": "What type of coaches will benefit from BST COACH platform?",
                "answer": "All coaches who know they cannot be with their athletes all the time. Our training platform can never replace a good coach because coaching means more than just writing a training plan, but we can be a great training tool that scales and makes the training process more consistent & engaging.",

            {
                "question": "How can my athletes train with a phone in their hands?",
                "answer": "They don't have to. It won't take very long until athletes will know the exercises by name. They won't even have to open most of the videos. The phone will only serve as a cheat sheet reminder. Athletes can also familiarize themselves with the training plan beforehand.",
            },

                "question": "Can athletes use BST COACH to create their own training?",
                "answer": "For sure. Many athletes are extremely in tune with their own bodies, and they know what training they need for themselves.",

                "question": "Can I use BST COACH for personal training purposes?",

                "answer": "The critical age we focus on is 12-16 where most of the general athleticism foundations are built. We estimate that until about 12, athletes mostly prefer game-format training. However, our exercises have been effectively applied to train 7-year-olds and 70-year - olds alike.",

                "question": "What equipment do my athletes need for BST COACH exercises?",
                "answer": "Currently we offer minimal equipment exercise videos. Once in a while you might need a jump rope, stop watch, workout mat, resistance band, medicine ball, physio ball, tennis ball, boxes, hurdles, some light weights or other basic equipment… For the start, it will be plenty if your athletes are equipped with curiosity to learn and the will to become resilient athletes.",
            },

                "question": "What if some of my athletes cannot execute certain exercises?",

                "question": "Can I add someone else's videos from YouTube or Vimeo?",
                "answer": "Yes. But we strongly recommend that you contact the owner of the videos before using their resources or simply create your own video library on YouTube or Vimeo to later transfer over to BST COACH.",

                "question": "How can I deal with changing variables, such as training facilities, weather, equipment availability?",
                "answer": "BST COACH lets you create 2 training plans under the same day: one regular plan and one Alternative Plan. Many of the bst library resources are designed for home-based training that require minimal space and equipment. Modified training is not skipped training.",

                "answer": "No. You have complete freedom in how you communicate your training to your athletes. You can simply write text notes and describe what you want your athletes to do. Whatever is the most effective. Our videos will be mostly applied when the coach cannot be present or demonstrate the exercises.",

                "question": "How many training plans can I create for my athletes?",
                "answer": "As many as you wish. Price will not change. We have tested the platform with athletes at different age groups over a two-year period, and we found that saving each week's plan for the following cycle or even year, saves a lot of time and energy because coaches can recycle large parts of what they already made.",

Coaches can build and share training routines and plans that fit the overarching philosophy of the training group or organization.Each coach will have their own corner on the Group Page and every coach within the Team will be able to draw from all posted resources within the Group Page.",
